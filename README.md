A walkthrough for making your own operating system in Rust, inspired by [Philipp Oppermann's blog "Writing an OS in Rust"](https://os.phil-opp.com/)

## ðŸš§ In Construction ðŸš§
Feel free to follow parts 0..=10. If you see more parts, keep in mind that they might be incomplete and completely rewritten. Also, even parts 0..=10 could be completely rewritten, since this tutorial will constantly evolve. 

## Contribution Welcome
This is a tutorial and meant to be a community project. Contributions are welcome. Some examples are:
- Fixing typos in tutorial or code
- Making improvements to tutorial or code
- Adding translations
- Making a nice website for this tutorial
- Adding new parts (but make an issue first so we can plan it first)

## Looking at / contributing to the code
Every part's code (files in general) builds off of the previous part. So this uses `git worktree` for the tutorial operating system's files. To view a part, run
```bash
git worktree add part-0 --guess-remote
```

## Looking at the tutorial
Go to the `Part 0.md` file.
